# Binary Search Tree (BST) 

## Introduction

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children referred to as the left child and the right child. It has the following properties:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

BSTs are used in many applications, such as searching, sorting, and maintaining a dynamic set of ordered elements.

## Project Overview

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++ with the following functionalities:
1. **Insert**: Insert a new node into the BST.
2. **Search**: Search for a node in the BST.
3. **Delete**: Delete a node from the BST.
4. **Inorder Traversal**: Traverse and print the BST in an inorder sequence.
5. **Preorder Traversal**: Traverse and print the BST in a preorder sequence.
6. **Postorder Traversal**: Traverse and print the BST in a postorder sequence.
7. **Find Minimum**: Find the node with the minimum key in the BST.
8. **Find Maximum**: Find the node with the maximum key in the BST.
9. **Height Calculation**: Calculate the height of the BST.

## How to Run the C++ Code

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or any other code editor

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. **Compile the code**:
   g++ main.cpp -o bst

3. **Run the Executable**:
   ./bst

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. The BST supports standard operations like insertion, deletion, search, and various traversal methods, along with additional functionalities such as finding minimum/maximum keys and calculating the tree height. This serves as a foundational example for understanding and working with binary search trees in C++.
